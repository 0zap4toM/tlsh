# TLSH - Trend Micro Locality Sensitive Hash

TLSH is a fuzzy matching library.
Given a byte stream with a minimum length of 50 bytes
TLSH generates a hash value which can be used for similarity comparisons.
Similar objects will have similar hash values which allows for
the detection of similar objects by comparing their hash values.  Note that
the byte stream should have a sufficient amount of complexity.  For example,
a byte stream of identical bytes will not generate a hash value.

## Minimum byte stream length

The program in default mode requires an input byte stream with a minimum length of 50 bytes
(and a minimum amount of randomness - see note in Python extension below).

For consistency with older versions, there is a -conservative option which enforces a 256 byte limit.
See notes for version 3.17.0 of TLSH

## Computed hash

The computed hash is 35 bytes long (output as 70 hexidecimal charactes). The
first 3 bytes are used to capture the information about the file as a whole
(length, ...), while the last 32 bytes are used to capture information about
incremental parts of the file.  (Note that the length of the hash can be
increased by changing build parameters described below in [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt),
which will increase the information stored in the hash.
For some applications this might increase the accuracy in predicting similarities between files.)

## Executables and library

Building TLSH (see below) will create a static library in the `lib` directory,
and the `tlsh` executable (a symbolic link to `tlsh_unittest`).
'tlsh' links to the static library, in the `bin` directory.
The library has functionality to generate the hash value from a given
file, and to compute the similarity between two hash values.

`tlsh` is a utility for generating TLSH hash values and comparing TLSH
hash values to determine similarity.  Run it with no parameters for detailed usage.

## Ports

- A JavaScript port available in the `js_ext` directory.
- A Java port is available in the `java` directory.
- Another Java port is available [here](https://github.com/idealista/tlsh).
- A Golang port is available [here](https://github.com/glaslos/tlsh).
- A Ruby port is available [here](https://github.com/adamliesko/tlsh)

# Downloading TLSH

Download TLSH as follows:

```
wget https://github.com/trendmicro/tlsh/archive/master.zip -O master.zip
unzip master.zip
cd tlsh-master
```

**or**

```
git clone git://github.com/trendmicro/tlsh.git
cd tlsh
git checkout master
```

# Building TLSH

Edit [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt) to build TLSH with different options.

- TLSH_BUCKETS: determines using 128 or 256 buckets
	use the default 128 buckets unless you are an expert and know you need 256 buckets
- TLSH_CHECKSUM_1B: determines checksum length, longer means less collision
	use the default 1 byte unless you are an expert and know you need a larger checksum

## Linux

Execute:

```
make.sh
```

**Note:** *Building TLSH on Linux depends upon `cmake` to create the `Makefile` and then
`make` the project, so the build will fail if `cmake` is not installed.*

## Windows (MinGW)

Added in March 2020.
See the instructions in README.mingw

## Windows (Visual Studio)

Use the version-specific tlsh solution files ([tlsh.VC2005.sln](Windows/tlsh.VC2005.sln),
[tlsh.VC2008.sln](Windows/tlsh.VC2008.sln), ...) under the Windows directory.

See [tlsh.h](include/tlsh.h) for the tlsh library interface and [tlsh_unittest.cpp](test/tlsh_unittest.cpp) and
[simple_unittest.cpp](test/simple_unittest.cpp) under the `test` directory for example code.

## Python Extension

There is a README.python with notes about the python version

```
(1) compile the C++ code
	$./make.sh
(2) build the python version
	$ cd py_ext/
	$ python ./setup.py build
(3) install - possibly - sudo, run as root or administrator
	$ python ./setup.py install
(4) test it
	$ cd ../Testing
	$ ./python_test.sh
```

### Python API

```python
import tlsh
tlsh.hash(data)
```


Note that in default mode the data must contain at least 50 bytes to generate a hash value and that
it must have a certain amount of randomness.
If you use the "conservative" option, then the data must contain at least 256 characters.
For example, `tlsh.hash(str(os.urandom(256)))`, should always generate a hash.  
To get the hash value of a file, try `tlsh.hash(open(file, 'rb').read())`.

```python
tlsh.diff(h1, h2)
tlsh.diffxlen(h1, h2)
```

The `diffxlen` function removes the file length component of the tlsh header from
the comparison.  If a file with a repeating pattern is compared to a file
with only a single instance of the pattern, then the difference will be increased
if the file lenght is included.  But by using the `diffxlen` function, the file
length will be removed from consideration.

Note that the python API has been extended to miror the C++ API.  See
py_ext/tlshmodule.cpp and the py_ext/test.py script to see the full API set.

# Design Choices

- To improve comparison accuracy, TLSH tracks counting bucket height
  distribution in quartiles. Bigger quartile difference results in higher
  difference score.
- Use specially 6 trigrams to give equal representation of the bytes in the 5
  byte sliding window which produces improved results.
- Pearson hash is used to distribute the trigram counts to the counting buckets.
- The global similarity score distances objects with significant size
  difference. Global similarity can be disabled. It also distances objects with
  different quartile distributions.
- TLSH can be compiled to generate 70 or 134 characters hash strings.
  The longer version has been created to use of the 70 char hash strings is not working
  for your application.

TLSH similarity is expressed as a difference score:

- A score of 0 means the objects are almost identical.
- For the 70 characters hash, there is a detailed table of experimental Detection rates and False Positive rates
  based on the threshhold. see [Table II on page 5](https://github.com/trendmicro/tlsh/blob/master/TLSH_CTC_final.pdf)
